When a membrane is scanned perpendicularly to its surface, the fluorescence signal
originating from the membrane itself must be separated from the signal of the
surrounding medium for an FCS analysis. PyScanFCS interactively extracts the
fluctuating fluorescence signal from such measurements and applies a multiple-tau
algorithm. The obtained correlation curves can be evaluated using
[PyCorrFit](http://paulmueller.github.io/PyCorrFit/).
