# Exponentially correlated noise
# This is a test function used to check times of exponentially
# correlated noise.

# Fraction
Purity = 0.5

# Exp time
tauexp [ms] = 2.0

# You may choose to substitute certain parts of the correlation function
# with other values for easy reading. This can be done by using the
# prefix "g". You may use all common mathematical functions,
# such as "sqrt()" or "exp()". For convenience, "pi" and "e" may also
# be used. If you are paranoid, you always use float numbers with a dot "."
# to be sure the program doesn't accidently do integer division.

gTrip = Purity/(1-Purity)*exp(-tau/tauexp)

# The final line with the correlation function should start with a "G"
# before the "=" sign.

G = gTrip
