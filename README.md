PyScanFCS
=========

This repository contains the source code of PyScanFCS - a tool for data evaluation in perpendicular line scanning FCS.

When a membrane is scanned perpendicular to its surface, the fluorescence signal originating from the membrane itself must be separeted from the signal of the surrounding medium for an FCS analysis.
PyScanFCS interactively extracts the fluorecence fluctuation signal from such measurements and applies a multiple-tau algorithm. The obtained correlation curves can be evaluated using [PyCorrFit](https://github.com/paulmueller/PyCorrFit).
