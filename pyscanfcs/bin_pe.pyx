    """Convert photon arrival times to a binned trace

    Bin all photon arrival times in a numpy.uint32 array *data*, using
    the binning time float *t_bin* and saving the intensity trace as
    the file *filename*. *dlg* is a python object that supports
    dlg.Update, like a progress dialog.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray (uint32)
        photon events to be binned
    t_bin : (double)
        binning time
    binshift : int
        adding a number of zeros at the beginning of the binned data
    outfile : str
        path to store output
    outdtype : dtype
        numpy dtype of the output file
    callback : callable or None
        Callback function to be called throughout the algorithm. If the
        return value of `callback` is not None, the function will abort.
        Number of function calls: 100
    cb_kwargs : dict, optional
        Keyword arguments for `callback` (e.g. "pid" of process).

    Returns
    -------
    filename : str
        The filename of the binned data.

    Notes
    -----
    The photon stream `data` is created by a program called `Photon.exe`
    from correlator.com.
